  <h1>Steal The Grinch</h1>
  <p>Welcome to GinoDiaz.Net, Here are the rules of "Steal The Grinch" game.</p> 
  <ol>
  <li>If you are given a Grinch token, you must always keep it on your person. Not hiding it in your car or a bag or closet, it must be with you. </li>
  <li>Try to “steal” a Grinch by simply asking someone if they have one. Like this: “Hi, love you, by the way, do you have a Grinch?” </li>
  <li>If you are asked for a Grinch and you have one you MUST give the Grinch to that person. Also, you are not allowed to ask for Grinch back from that person, unless you know for sure, that person has a different Grinch. </li>
  <li>If you see someone give up a Grinch to someone else, you must wait 5mins before asking for that Grinch.</li>
  <li>You can only hold one Grinch.  When the game is over and if you have more than one Grinch you are disqualified.</li>
  <li>This game will be over at the start of the White Elephant game. I will be giving some gifts for those Grinch tokens.</li>
   </ol>
